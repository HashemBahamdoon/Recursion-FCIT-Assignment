# Recursion Assignment - Java Project

This project is a Java assignment focused on recursion. It was created on October 9, 2020, and aims to provide solutions to various problems using recursive techniques. The assignment also involves reading input from a file and writing the solutions to an external file.

## Problem Statement
The assignment consists of several problems that require recursive solutions. The problems include:

1. PrintHexNum: This method converts a decimal number to its hexadecimal representation.

2. Noccurrences: This method checks if a given string contains a certain substring with a minimum number of occurrences.

3. DescArrayCheck: This method checks whether the elements of an array are sorted in descending order.

The assignment provides explanations and implementations for each problem, utilizing recursive algorithms.

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure that the input file ("input.in.txt") is in the project directory.
4. Run the `Recursion` class as the main program.
5. The program will read the commands from the input file, perform the recursive operations, and write the results to the output file ("output.out.txt").

Please note that the program assumes the input file follows the specified format.

## Examples
The project includes example solutions to each problem, demonstrating how the recursion works and providing expected outputs. These examples can serve as a guide for understanding the recursive algorithms and their usage.
